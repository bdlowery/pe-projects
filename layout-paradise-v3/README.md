# Hello!

This was a project for [Perpetual Education's](https://perpetual.education) "Design For The Web" course.

# Goal

Given the same HTML as everyone else in the class, create a website design targeted at a specific industry. After creating my design and implementing it with CSS I was given the approval to change the HTML and hydrate the page with specific body copy for each theme.

## My Industry

I chose a "beach vacation" company.

* There's 2 different themes for 2 different audiences. 

* One is a family-friendly resort, the other is an adult-only resort.

* Click on the links in the header to switch between themes.

# Portfolio Zone

This project is all about routers, and making my own with PHP to understand how they work.

# Goal

Take any site you want and explore routing with PHP.

## My site

I finished mocking up my Portfolio and already had all of the content I needed, so I chose that. The Portfolio Zone.

- Every link in the menu uses query strings, and based on the value of the query string I can decided what route the user wants to see.

- There is a mock database to understand that not all data will be hard coded.

- The styles for each page are based on the route the user navigates too.

- Has a custom PHP router by retrieving the value of the query string and showing the page based on that value.

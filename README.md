# Brian Lowery's Portfolio

This is my portfolio! I'm using HTML, CSS, and PHP.

# Goal

I used PHP to get a better understand of how to use functions, and routing. I made my own router to understand how Wordpress handles it under the hood, as well as frameworks like React and Vue.

## My site

- Every link in the menu uses query strings, and based on the value of the query string I can decided what route the user wants to see.

- There are multiple mock databases to get used to not all data being hardcoded.

- The styles for each page are based on the route the user navigates too.

- Has a custom PHP router by retrieving the value of the query string and showing the page based on that value.

- Has a working dark mode. Also takes into account if the user sets their system preferences to dark mode with the prefers-color-scheme media query.

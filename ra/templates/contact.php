	<p class='calm-voice'>We're not sorry to say that we are busy. We're busy designing things. So, we can't answer the phone and break the focus.</p>

	<p class='calm-voice'>Instead, <a href='https://calendly.com/perpetual-education' target='calendar'>book a time</a> to talk. If it's a quick talk - there are more open times. You can choose which type of meeting works best for you.</p>

	<p class='calm-voice'>We look forward to meeting you.</p>
